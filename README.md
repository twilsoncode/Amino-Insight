# Amino Insight

---

This is the repository for Amino Insight. It should be noted that the code is not commented, but hopefully you will be able to follow along. In order to run this project, you must install Python and the required libraries as noted below. Then by typing in the command `flask run` into the terminal, when you are in the project folder, a development server should start with a link to running the application locally. This is not a deployment that should be made on a public website as there are adjustments that must be made, however it is useful if you would like to play around with the code locally. The Amino Insight website is linked [here](https://aminoinsight.com/) or it can be found on Google by searching for "Amino Insight".
